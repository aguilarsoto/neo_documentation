#Introduction to NEO


This is where your introduction to NEO's world start, here you will learn how the messages are composed what to expect on the responses and what parts of them are important for your application.

 Here we will introduce you to the two call architecture of NEO and explain why is important, we will also talk about the different parts of the NEO servers.


 For the examples bellow we will use:

 * The Orchestration Server: https://o-us-east-1a-service-vianeodev1.neo.intralinks.com

   * The Location Path: /location

   * The Entitlement Path: /entitlement

* The Content Server: https://c01-il-bos-service-vianeodev1.neo.intralinks.com

   * The Assets Path: /asset

   * The Search Path: /search

All the work from the app server can be split in two sections. one the requests to access information (the most common ones, going to the location path) and the request to update the entitlements (going to the entitlement path).







# Welcome

This is where it all starts, your first path page. This page is your chance to make a great first impression. So let your personality come through and make sure to get your learners excited about embarking on your path.

The best way to keep your learners' attention is with a crisp description of what your path is all about. For this sample path, the goal is get you started with creating your own Outlearn content as fast as possible. The target audience is **you**, and anyone else wanting to share amazing learning resources with other devs on a platform specifically built to let your content shine.

Next, it's important to highlight what learners should get out of your course.  For example, pretty soon you will be able to:

* Fork your own copy of this template learning repository
* Publish your own path into Outlearn
* Enrich your Markdown with things like _Todos_ or _Unfurled Links_

Make sure to set the right expectations about time and effort as well. For example, this sample path is quite short, no more than 5 minutes.  Of course, if you decide to start working on your own path, there's no telling...time stands still when a great developer gets deep in the flow!

No matter what kind of a role you are in, you are most likely teaching people. That includes on-boarding a new colleague, mentoring a junior developer, managing a team, or spreading the word about an open source project. We bet that we can make it easier for you to do some of that teaching. Go on and give it a try.

Cheers,
The Outlearn Team
